# F04/F18/F06 Implementation Log (Worker B)

Date: 2026-02-15
File modified: /Users/aaaaa/Projects/tui-visualizer/src/visual/presets.rs

## Completed
- F04 deep fractal zoom upgrades:
  - Reworked deep zoom progression for smoother continuous growth without periodic reset behavior.
  - Added deep camera coordinate rebasing-style centering to keep deep dives stable and reduce early drift into low-detail space.
  - Added lightweight deep-detail perturbation/modulation stage in Mandel/Julia/Burning Ship deep paths.
- F18 procedural geometry bank expansion:
  - Added 6 new CPU algorithms/presets with distinct visual structures.
  - Added quality-tier-aware complexity in iterative presets (Hopalong, Ikeda, Phyllotaxis, Nova).
- F06 reactive CPU post-processing:
  - Added post-FX chain hooks (audio-reactive chroma split, scanline shaping, vignette, bloom-ish neighborhood glow).
  - Added explicit frame-size bounds guards and clamped sampling paths for safe writes and reads.
- F07 preparatory routing:
  - Added compact multi-band routing helper (`RouteMap`) to map audio features into shared control parameters used by deep fractals and post-FX.

## New preset names
- Hopalong Attractor: Neon Dust
- Ikeda Loop: Bass Cyclone
- Hex Tunnel: Lattice Drive
- Gyroid Slice: Reactor Core
- Phyllotaxis Bloom: Harmonic Seeds
- Nova Fractal: Root Resonance

## Validation
- Command run: `cargo build --release`
- Result: success
